                <h2>Why dandelion?</h2>
                
                <p>Dandelion recipes keep things wild in the kitchen in early spring, and there’s nothing like a 
                    bright fresh blossoms and zesty wild greens after a long winter of heavy food. Dandelions are 
                    exciting to backyard foragers because they’re one of the easiest wild plants to safely identify. Though they do have a few look likes (coltsfoot in the very early spring and hawks eye in the fall), most children know how to spot dandelion plants with ease.</p>

            <div class="where">

                <h2 id="where-link">Where does it grow?</h2>
                
                <p>Dandelions grow just about everywhere because their seeds are dispersed high into the 
                    atmosphere and they’ve colonized just about every habitable place on earth. I’ve heard from a number of people that they just don’t have them, which always surprises me. If you’re short 
                    on dandelions, you can always grow your own. The seeds are absurdly cheap, coming in packs of 10,000 seeds or more.</p>

            <div class="what">

                <h2 id="what-link">What part can you eat?</h2>
                
                <p>Every part of a dandelion is edible, from the roots to the leaves and flowers, even the 
                    unopened flower buds and flower stalks. There are literally hundreds of dandelion recipes that offer creative ideas for using every part of the plant, both for food and medicine. That’s right, dandelions are more than just edible! They’re also great as a spring medicine, providing much-needed bitters to
                    help cleanse the system in anticipation of warmer weather. They can be made into all manner of
                    tinctures, teas, salves, and soaps.</p>

            <div class="medical">

                <h2 id="medical-link">Is there a medical benefit to dandelions?</h2>
                
                <p>While dandelions may seem like just another weed, they were once respected as powerful 
                    medicine. Modern science is baking up this old knowledge, and peer-reviewed studies are confirming what herbalists have known for centuries. According to Backyard Medicine, dandelions are used to treat Skin Problems, Constipation & Fluid Retention, Urinary Problems, Liver Issues and Arthritis & Muscle Tension.</p>
