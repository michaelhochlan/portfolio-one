		    <br>
		        <p>If you’ve missed them in the early spring, you can always buy dried dandelion root online. That’ll save you a lot of time, as hunting down and digging up the dandelion roots took quite a while. I found it takes about 15 dandelion roots to make enough dry roasted dandelion root for a cup of coffee.</p>

		    <h3>Preparing dandelion roots for roasting</h3>

                <p>Once you have the roots, wash them thoroughly. Chop off the upper leaves
                and save those for a tasty dandelion salad later. I separated the
                smaller, scraggly parts of the roots out because they’ll just burn
                during roasting. The small root pieces are going right into a dandelion
                tincture, and these big hunks are ready for the oven.</p>

            <h3>Roasting dandelion roots </h3>

                <p>Most online instructions will tell you to roast fresh dandelion root at 400 degrees F (roughly 200 C) for 30 minutes until they’re completely dry and brown, but not burned. My oven tends to run a bit hot, and I was concerned about scorching them, so I set the oven to 350 degrees and roasted them for 40 minutes. They came out perfect. Dry and toasted, but not burned.</p>

        <img src="assets/images/coffee-4.webp" alt="Picture of fine and rough cut dandelion roots" style="width: 50%" id="article-img" />

            <h3>Brewing dandelion root coffee</h3>

                <p>Once your dandelion root is roasted, it’s time to make coffee. Really, dandelion root coffee is made more like a tea, and you don’t actually have to grind the dandelion root.</p>
            <br>
                <p>Boil the roasted dandelion root along with spices of your choice for about 10-15 minutes. I started with 2 cups of water, but after the simmering time, I had exactly one cup of dandelion coffee. Strain the mix through a fine-mesh strainer and it’s ready to drink.</p>

            <h3>What does dandelion coffee taste like?</h3>

                <p>So now that it’s all said and done, what does dandelion coffee actually taste like? Honestly, I think it tastes pretty well like coffee, but without the acid. The same warm earthy tones, and a very mild coffee bitterness, but none of the acid.</p>

            <h3>Enjoy!</h3>

            <h2>How to make dandelion capers?</h2>

                <p>Capers are a staple of our home cooking, and we eat them enough that I decided to learn how to 
                grow them myself. I was disappointed to learn that they need a long growing season and lots of heat to thrive, so no luck in Vermont. Traditional capers are the pickled flower buds of a heat-loving Mediterranean shrub, but there are a number of other pickled flower buds that taste remarkably similar.</p>
            <br>
                <p>Dandelions produce a small, caper-sized flower bud early in spring before the stem shoots skyward and opens into a flower. If picked small enough, dandelion buds can be made into convincing dandelion capers. That’s a homemade caper that just about anyone can grow!</p>

            <img src="assets/images/capers-1.webp" alt="Picture of pickled dandelion capers in a open jar" style="width: 50%" id="article-img" />

            <h3>Where are all the dandelion buds?</h3>

                <p>The first step is to find very tiny dandelion buds. I’m not talking about just plucking off closed flowers from the top of a dandelion stem. Those buds have already developed into a fully formed flower inside, and they’ll pickle into a squishy ball full of fluffy petals.</p>
            <br>
                <p>Capers have a bit of crunch to them, and to get that texture you need very young buds. Look at the ground for a telltale dandelion rosette. At the very center of a young plant, there will be a small dandelion bud very close to the ground. The stem hasn’t grown up yet, and the bud is still forming into a flower.</p>

            <img src="assets/images/capers-2.webp" alt="Picture of a dandelion bud inside the plant" style="width: 50%" id="article-img" />

                <p>The dandelion bud above is just starting to spit off its outer leaves. This is the very largest bud you’d use to make capers. If you want the good stuff though, go deeper. Once you pluck off that primary bud, underneath there will be a number of pea-sized secondary buds that are even younger.</p>

            <img src="assets/images/capers-3.webp" alt="Picture of several dandelion buds inside a plant" style="width: 50%" id="article-img" />

                <p>Once you pluck off that primary bud, underneath there will be a number of pea-sized secondary buds that are even younger.</p>
            <br>
                <p>Use your finger to pry these little buds out from the inside of the rosette. The primary bud came off easily, but these are deep down in there and take a bit more work. Once you have them out, all you need is roughly 100 more dandelions and you’ve got a batch of capers. Well, maybe not quite that many, but you get the idea.</p>

            <img src="assets/images/capers-4.webp" alt="Picture of dandelion buds on an opened hand" style="width: 50%" id="article-img" />

                <p>Once I showed this handful of “secret dandelion buds” to my daughter she went to work. It’s like a scavenger hunt for a tiny kid, and my baby girl filled the jar in no time flat. Now that you have the buds, it’s time to pickle them.</p>
            <br>
                <p>Dandelion capers can be made just like homemade pickles, using a vinegar and salt brine. Using this method, they can be water bath canned for long-term preservation or just popped into the refrigerator for more immediate use.</p>

            <h3>pickled dandelion capers</h3>

            <img src="assets/images/Capers-5.webp" alt="Picture of pickled dandelion capers in a open jar" style="width: 50%" id="article-img" />

                <p>This method of making dandelion capers uses salt and vinegar to create a pickle that can be canned for long-term preservation or stored in the refrigerator for a few months.</p>
            <br>

        <div class="capers-recepie">

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <br>
            <h3>2 cups dandelion buds</h3>
            <h3>2/3 cups vinegar</h3>
            <h3>1/3 cup water</h3>
            <h3>1 tsp salt</h3>    
        <br>
        <br>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <br>
            <h3>1. Bring the water to a boil and stir and disolve the salt and add the vinegar.</h3>
            <h3>2. Pack the capers into mason jars and pour the brine over the top.</h3>
            <h3>3. Cap and store in the refrigerator or process in a water bath canner for 10 minutes, leaving 1/2 inch of headspace.</h3>
        <br>
        <br>
    </div>

        <p>The traditional way of pickling, before canning and all that, involved just salt and water. The vegetables were lacto-fermented in this brine, in the same way that sauerkraut still is today. Instead of adding vinegar, the lactic acid bacteria produced their own acid to preserve the food. Or make fermented dandelion bud capers, all you need is a mason jar fermentation kit and a bit of salted water.</p>

            <h3>Enjoy!</h3>

            <h2>How to make dandelion tincture?</h2>

                <p>Dandelion tincture is a natural spring tonic that’s traditionally used to increase energy and cleanse the system after a long winter indoors. It’s often made as a simple dandelion root tincture, but you can also make a whole plant dandelion tincture to enjoy the benefits of every part of this medicinal wild weed.</p>

            <img src="assets/images/tincture-1.webp" alt="Picture of a person holding a jar of dendelion tincture" style="width: 50%" id="article-img"/>

                <p>After a long winter, dandelions are a welcome sight in the yard. Their bright sunny blossoms signal that spring has arrived, and their golden blossoms are food for the soul. While some people hate dandelions and do their best to eradicate them, their determination and weedy growth habit make that all but impossible.</p>
            <br>
                <p>But why would you want to destroy such a nutritious and beneficial spring weed? Dandelions arrive just when our bodies need a little pick me up after a long winter of heavy foods. They’re a bitter tonic, perfect for cleansing the system and boosting energy so you can make the most of sunny spring days. Every part of a dandelion is edible and medicinal, from the bright yellow petals, down the stem to the green spring leaves and into the soil with their long tap root.</p>
            <br>
                <p>The leaves make for delicious fresh spring salads, and the flowers make a tasty dandelion wine. Dandelion roots can be cooked like carrots, believe it or not, and they’re tasty in their own right too. Beyond just eating dandelions in season, you can also preserve their medicinal benefits for use year-round as a simple dandelion tincture.</p>

            <img src="assets/images/tincture-2.webp" alt="Picture of a person holding a whole dandelion plant and a small bottle of dendelion tincture" style="width: 50%" id="article-img" />

                <p>Always consult your doctor or a clinical herbalist before trying any new herbal remedy, as there’s always the possibility of unintended consequences, allergic reaction, or interactions with other medication.</p>
            <br>
                <p>If you’re harvesting wild plant material, make sure you’re 100% confident in your identification and consult multiple sources for your ID. The following is based on my research and experience, but I don’t claim to have any certifications that would qualify me to advise you on your health. Please do your own research and always verify with multiple reputable sources.</p>

            <h3>What is dandelion root tincture used for?</h3>    
            
            <br>
                <p>Dandelion is a well-known digestive herb, and a few drops can be taken before mea ls to prevent gas and after meals for heartburn. It’s also known as a clesing herb that supports healthy liver and kidney function. The same cleansing action is used as a blood purifier that can help reduce blood cholesterol.</p>
            <br>
                <p>As a gentle diuretic, a dandelion tincture is used as a treatment for UTIs and water retention. Herbalists also prescribe dandelion tincture to promote healthy, clear skin. Traditionally, it’s also been used to help build energy and endurance, which can be helpful after a long winter indoors. According to the herbalist Julie Bruton-Seal, a dandelion tincture is used for:</p>
            <br>

        <div class="tincture-list">

            <h3>Skin problems</h3>
            <h3>Sluggish liver</h3>
            <h3>Constipation</h3>
            <h3>Urinary Problems</h3>
            <h3>Fluid Retention</h3>
            <h3>Arthritis</h3>
            <h3>Gout</h3>
            <h3>Hangovers</h3>
            <h3>Chronic Illness</h3>
        </div>
        <br>

            <h3>Ingredients for dandelion tincture</h3>

                <p>Generally, a dandelion tincture is made either with just dandelion roots or as a whole plant tincture. The roots have the most concentrated medicinal benefits when it comes to moving lymph and promoting healthy liver function, and if you buy dandelion tincture, it will almost always be made from just dandelion roots. Since dandelion roots are often roasted to make dandelion root coffee, you can often buy dried dandelion root online, which will help you make this tincture before your own spring dandelions arrive.</p>
            <br>
                <p>These days, however, herbalists are starting to use more whole-plant extracts to get a more balanced tincture that incorporates the medicinal benefits of the whole plant. When you’re making a dandelion tincture, you can choose which parts to use, be it whole plant or just roots. If you do opt to use the aerial parts, be sure you include a lot well washed dandelion roots into the mix. (If you want something light and floral instead, you can make a dandelion flower liqueur, which is delicious…but doesn’t pack the medicinal punch of whole plant or dandelion root tincture.)</p>
            <br>

            <img src="assets/images/tincture-3.webp" alt="Picture of all the parts of a dandelion seperated on a table" style="width: 50%" id="article-img" />

                <p>Beyond the plant material, you’ll also need what’s known as a herbal menstruum or extraction liquid, which is almost always a neutral spirit like vodka. I like to use a mid-shelf vodka, as the bottom-shelf brands can be a bit harsh and make it hard to take your medicine. Vodka has a neutral flavor and really just works to extract the medicinal benefits from the dandelion plant and preserve them at the same time.</p>
            <br>
                <p>You can also use any other spirit you’d like, and whisky, brandy, or gin work well too. Generally, tinctures need to be at least 20% alcohol for preservation, and nowadays, herbalists shoot for 25% for safety. Since the dandelion plant material contains a good bit of water when fresh, you’ll need to use a spirit that’s at least 60 proof (30% alcohol). If you’re avoiding alcohol, you can make an alcohol-free herbal glycerite instead, and I’ll include instructions for that in the recipe card as well.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Harvesting dandelion for tincture</h3>

            <br>
                <p>Be aware that when you harvest dandelion for tincture, you’ll be harvesting the whole plant, including the root. For most plants, that means killing the plant, but dandelion is surprisingly resilient. If you leave just a tiny portion of the root in the soil, it can often resprout the following year.</p>
            <br>
                <p>To fill a quart jar for whole plant dandelion tincture, you only need 2 to 3 whole dandelion plants. If you’re using just dandelion root, you’ll need the big tap roots from about ten good-sized plants, and you can save the greens for salads.</p>
            <br>

            <img src="assets/images/tincture-5.webp" alt="Picture of a person holding several whole dandelion plants" style="width: 50%" id="article-img" />

            <br>
                <p>On our 30 acres here in Vermont, we have enough wild dandelion to harvest several tractor-trailer loads each spring without really denting the population. We’re basically dandelion farmers. For the most part, I leave them in place to feed the bees, but I do weed out my raised garden beds each year before planting time.</p>
            <br>
                <p>I’ll “harvest” several wheelbarrows full of whole dandelions each spring in the process of weeding my garden beds, without even touching the acres of fields surrounding my house. That’s more than enough for all the dandelion tincture I could ever want, plus every single dandelion recipe in the book! (Don’t worry, not a bit is wasted…)</p>

            <br>

            <h3>How to make dandelion tincture?</h3>

            <br>
                <p>To make a dandelion tincture, first, decide if you’re making a dandelion root tincture or whole plant dandelion tincture. Next, harvest the dandelions from a clean, unsprayed location that’s far away from roads or other sources of contamination. If you’ve missed the season, you can buy dried dandelion root online. You’ll need about 2-3 plants per quart for whole plant tincture or about ten good-sized roots for plain root tincture. Thoroughly wash the dandelions, scrubbing to remove any dirt. While it’s true that you will strain out all the plant material from your tincture before using, any dirt that’s in there will impact the flavor.</p>
            <br>
                <p>It doesn’t “hurt” you in any way, as they say, “a little dirt don’t hurt,”…but it doesn’t taste good either. And, if there’s a lot of grit in there, you should filter with cheesecloth rather than a plain fine mesh strainer so that you really pull it all out and just save the liquid in the end. Once the plants are washed, chop them really thoroughly to aid extraction and then pack them into a jar. I’m using a quart jar, but you can use a pint or a half gallon, whatever suits your needs.</p>
            <br>

            <img src="assets/images/tincture-1.webp" alt="Picture of a person holding a jar of dendelion tincture" style="width: 50%" id="article-img" />

            <br>
                <p>Pack the chopped roots into a mason jar, and cover them with alcohol. Ideally, the jar is about 2/3 full of fresh roots (or freshly chopped whole plant) and then it’s filled to within an inch of the top with vodka. I like to use Smirnoff for my homemade tinctures because it’s relatively cheap, but not so cheap that the tincture is hard to take. For your own use, choose the cheapest vodka that you’d voluntarily drink.</p>
            <br>
                <p>Allow the tincture to infuse in a cool dark place, giving it a shake anytime you remember. The dandelion root tincture needs at least a month to infuse, but ideally, 6 to 8 weeks to gain full potency. If you need the tincture sooner than that, you can buy prepared dandelion tincture online to tide you over while your own dandelion tincture is infusing. Once the tincture is finished, strain it through a fine-mesh strainer, and store the tincture in amber dropper bottles</p>
            <br>
