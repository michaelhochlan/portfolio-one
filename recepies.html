				Dandelion roots don’t pull up easily from our hard clay soils. It took a
				trowel and later a full-on shovel to get these babies out intact. Look
				for dandelion rosettes popping out of the soil in the early spring,
				before they’ve gone to flower. Once the dandelions have gone to flower
				the roots will shrink and become bitter and woody as the plant sends
				energy up to the flower.</p>
			<br>
		<p>
				If you’ve missed them in the early spring, you can always buy dried dandelion root online. That’ll save you a lot of time, as hunting down and digging up the dandelion roots took quite a while. I found it takes about 15 dandelion roots to make enough dry roasted dandelion root for a cup of coffee.

		<h3>Preparing dandelion roots for roasting</h3>
        <p>
            Once you have the roots, wash them thoroughly. Chop off the upper leaves
            and save those for a tasty dandelion salad later. I separated the
            smaller, scraggly parts of the roots out because they’ll just burn
            during roasting. The small root pieces are going right into a dandelion
            tincture, and these big hunks are ready for the oven.
        </p>

        <h3>Roasting dandelion roots </h3>

        <p>
            Most online instructions will tell you to roast fresh dandelion root at 400 degrees F (roughly 200 C) for 30 minutes until they’re completely dry and brown, but not burned. My oven tends to run a bit hot, and I was concerned about scorching them, so I set the oven to 350 degrees and roasted them for 40 minutes. They came out perfect. Dry and toasted, but not burned.
        </p>

        <h3>Brewing dandelion root coffee</h3>

        <p>
            Once your dandelion root is roasted, it’s time to make coffee. Really, dandelion root coffee is made more like a tea, and you don’t actually have to grind the dandelion root.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Boil the roasted dandelion root along with spices of your choice for about 10-15 minutes. I started with 2 cups of water, but after the simmering time, I had exactly one cup of dandelion coffee. Strain the mix through a fine-mesh strainer and it’s ready to drink.
        </p>

        <h3>What does dandelion coffee taste like?</h3>

        <p>
            So now that it’s all said and done, what does dandelion coffee actually taste like? Honestly, I think it tastes pretty well like coffee, but without the acid. The same warm earthy tones, and a very mild coffee bitterness, but none of the acid.
        </p>

        <h3>Enjoy!</h3>

                <h2>How to make dandelion capers</h2>

                <p>
                    Capers are a staple of our home cooking, and we eat them enough that I decided to learn how to 
                    grow them myself. I was disappointed to learn that they need a long growing season and lots of heat to thrive, so no luck in Vermont. Traditional capers are the pickled flower buds of a heat-loving Mediterranean shrub, but there are a number of other pickled flower buds that taste remarkably similar.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Dandelions produce a small, caper-sized flower bud early in spring before the stem shoots skyward and opens into a flower. If picked small enough, dandelion buds can be made into convincing dandelion capers. That’s a homemade caper that just about anyone can grow!
            </p>

            <img src="assets/images/capers-1.webp" alt="Picture of dandelions in a strainer" style="width: 50%" id="article-img" />

            <h3>Where are all the dandelion buds?</h3>

            <p>The first step is to find very tiny dandelion buds. I’m not talking about just plucking off closed flowers from the top of a dandelion stem. Those buds have already developed into a fully formed flower inside, and they’ll pickle into a squishy ball full of fluffy petals.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Capers have a bit of crunch to them, and to get that texture you need very young buds. Look at the ground for a telltale dandelion rosette. At the very center of a young plant, there will be a small dandelion bud very close to the ground. The stem hasn’t grown up yet, and the bud is still forming into a flower.
        </p>

            <img src="assets/images/capers-2.webp" alt="Picture of dandelions in a strainer" style="width: 50%" id="article-img" />

            <p>
                The dandelion bud above is just starting to spit off its outer leaves. This is the very largest bud you’d use to make capers. If you want the good stuff though, go deeper. Once you pluck off that primary bud, underneath there will be a number of pea-sized secondary buds that are even younger.
        </p>

        <p>Once you pluck off that primary bud, underneath there will be a number of pea-sized secondary buds that are even younger.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Use your finger to pry these little buds out from the inside of the rosette. The primary bud came off easily, but these are deep down in there and take a bit more work. Once you have them out, all you need is roughly 100 more dandelions and you’ve got a batch of capers. Well, maybe not quite that many, but you get the idea.
        </p>

        <img src="assets/images/capers-4.webp" alt="Picture of dandelions in a strainer" style="width: 50%" id="article-img" />

        <p>Once I showed this handful of “secret dandelion buds” to my daughter she went to work. It’s like a scavenger hunt for a tiny kid, and my baby girl filled the jar in no time flat. Now that you have the buds, it’s time to pickle them.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Dandelion capers can be made just like homemade pickles, using a vinegar and salt brine. Using this method, they can be water bath canned for long-term preservation or just popped into the refrigerator for more immediate use.
        </p>

        <h3>pickled dandelion capers</h3>

        <img src="assets/images/Capers-5.webp" alt="Picture of dandelions in a strainer" style="width: 50%" id="article-img" />

        <p>
            This method of making dandelion capers uses salt and vinegar to create a pickle that can be canned for long-term preservation or stored in the refrigerator for a few months.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>2 cups dandelion buds</h3>
        <h3>2/3 cups vinegar</h3>
        <h3>1/3 cup water</h3>
        <h3>1 tsp salt</h3>    
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>1. Bring the water to a boil and stir and disolve the salt.</h3>
        <h3>2. Pack the capers into mason jars and pour the brine over the top.</h3>
        <h3>3. Cap and store in the refrigerator or process in a water bath canner for 10 minutes, leaving 1/2 inch of headspace.</h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            The traditional way of pickling, before canning and all that, involved just salt and water. The vegetables were lacto-fermented in this brine, in the same way that sauerkraut still is today. Instead of adding vinegar, the lactic acid bacteria produced their own acid to preserve the food. Or make fermented dandelion bud capers, all you need is a mason jar fermentation kit and a bit of salted water.
        </p>
        <h3>Enjoy!</h3>
